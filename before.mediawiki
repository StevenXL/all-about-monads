''All About Monads'' is a tutorial on monads and monad transformers and a walk-through of common monad instances. You can download a PDF version [http://mauke.dyndns.org/stuff/haskell/All_About_Monads.pdf here].

Attempts are being made at porting the tutorial to this wiki; what you're seeing below is a preview of the result of that effort. If you wish to help out you should fork [https://github.com/dag/all-about-monads this GitHub repo] rather than edit this page, for now.
